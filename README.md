# Simple network diagnostics

This is meant as an _overly_ simple mechanism to collect and visualize network statistics over time to provide some ammo for telling your ISP that it is terrible.

## Requirements
Docker for your OS.

## Get started
1. Clone the repository
2. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
3. Open the sweet dashboard: http://localhost:3000/d/UyopENOiz/network-stats
4. Wait until data rolls in
